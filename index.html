       <h2 class="subheader">Background</h2>
       <p>My name is Aisha Abdirizak and I was born in Nairobi a city in Kenya on June 11th, 2003. I immigrated to the US at the age of six. My parents a couple of years prior had escaped a Civil War in Somalia. We thought Nairobi would be a better life, but with constant turmoil, we knew our lives could no longer remain there. Seeking refuge in the U.S would allow us to be free from the pain, to be free from trauma, and to be free from hunger that consumed my family and I every night. I wanted to grasp onto this American dream, even if it meant never waking up.</p>
        <p> After two years of sharing sleeping mats with strangers, allotting enough food to remain for weeks at a time, and constant power outages, through the lottery system a miracle had happened. My family heard the news that we were able to go to the U.S. Packing whatever clothes, we had remaining, I left to chase what I thought would be a better life.
            Arriving in Connecticut, I was introduced to the deafening coldness of the West. My first morning in our 1-bedroom apartment consisted of me looking out the window at the pale children playing in leaves. My life had completely changed. My mother, raising eight kids in a foreign land, always emphasized education as our ticket to freedom. Dedicated to making something of myself to provide for my family, I became involved with clubs at school, held a job to add support, and volunteered within my community all while challenging myself by taking college courses. Yet, no amount of achievement would protect me from being the subject of racial slurs and bias. In fact, at one point I had gotten suspended for fighting after I was ridiculed by a student who insisted on calling me derogatory terms. Looking back, I wish I had not stooped so low; my mother did not sacrifice everything to push me forward for me to fall back.
            </p>
        <p>All of the experiences I have had has led me to my passion for technology. From moments of being in the refugee camp witnessing inconsistent sources of power and a lack of a coherent system to categorize refugees, to being a part of Girls Who Code and interning for F5, a technology company, I have seen the ways in which tech can change lives. As a young Black Muslim woman, I recognize that the higher I go up in academia, the fewer and fewer faces like mine I will see. However, it is my goal to make the path easier for those who come after me; both by being a representation of what one can achieve and by creating programs that increase accessibility to access for young refugees like myself. Technology can change the future; I hope to be a part of that change.</p>
